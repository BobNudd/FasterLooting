# FasterLooting

FasterLooting is a simple addon with a simple purpose: loot instantly. No more waiting for the loot window to appear, no more waiting for the loot window to be populated with items, and certainly no more stopping your character next to each mob so you can loot. FasterLooting will loot every item available as soon as the loot window is ready. For you, this means you can just run by a mob, click once to loot it, and keep on running. Your loot will appear in your inventory and in your chat log.
